    "*I am interested in data science because over the past few years I have been learning more and more about spreadsheets and many of the advanced functions that can be used with them. Eventually I ran into the need to 'query' large data sets, and a friend of mine told me about SQL. That was enough to set me off on more learning, and I soon found out about the pandas library in Python, and started exploring even larger data sets with pandas. I am not sure what it is, but there is just something about being able to work with big data that I find fascinating. It is almost as if there are hidden puzzles waiting to be solved, and from all that I have learned so far, it seems as though learning more about data science will help equip me with the tools needed to solve those puzzles.*"
